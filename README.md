nodeclear
=========

A web-based Clear.app, using Node.js/Express+MongoDB for the API and AngularJS+Compass for the UI.

**$Why?** I wanted to get my feet wet in some new technologies, and I think Clear is an amazing app.

## What's finished, and what's not?

**Testing:** Because this is my first experiment in Node/Express, and my first non-tutorial venture into AngularJS, I didn't follow my normal test-driven development approach. To me, TDD kind of goes hand-in-hand with planning, and I didn't know enough about where my code would end up to test.

**Done-ish:**

 - API seems to work
 - Angular functionality [mostly]
 - API-Angular integration
 - It has styling... (which is nicer than with no styling!)

**Not done:**

 - Tests (unit and end-to-end)
 - UI could use some refinements and responsiveness
 - Some blank lists are misbehaving (but tests should reveal that)
